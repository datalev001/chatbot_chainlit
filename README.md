# Building a Productized AI Chatbot for Credit Card Business
Streamlined Integration of Mixed Tech in AI Chatbot Application
Imagine you're a customer with a pressing question about your credit card. You call customer support, but the wait time is long, and the process is frustrating. This is where our AI chatbot comes in, transforming how customer support is handled in the credit card industry.
When building a smarter, faster, and more secure customer support system, I realized the need for a chatbot that isn't just a novelty but a practical, production-ready tool. This chatbot uses AI technologies to ensure it's efficient, secure, and easy to deploy.
I used Azure OpenAI to build the chatbot because it's the best tool for understanding and responding to customer questions. However, keeping customer information safe is also important. To do this, we added Amazon Comprehend Moderation to protect personal data.
To make the chatbot more practical, I added a PostgreSQL database for specific data queries in the credit card business. 
Deploying this chatbot is straightforward thanks to Docker containers, making it easy to scale and manage. Using tools like ChainLit and ConversationBufferWindowMemory, the chatbot can maintain a conversational history. This provides an excellent and personalized customer experience.
By writing this post, I aim to share how these technologies create a robust AI chatbot that revolutionizes customer support in the credit card business.
